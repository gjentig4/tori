Yousician; Machine Learning/AI Software Developer (Python)

Dear Yousician Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Machine Learning/AI Software Developer position at Yousician. As a dedicated Data Analyst and a passionate music enthusiast, I believe my blend of experience in machine learning and music makes me a strong candidate for this role.

Machine Learning experience:
  Innovative Use of GPT-4 for Job Hunting: I've crafted a script using the GPT-4 API to directly compare my CV with job postings, like Yousician's. It identifies overlapping skills and qualifications, then gives a user-friendly summary of how well I match up. It's a testament to both my practical understanding of AI and my knack for using it to solve real-world problems. I've also used Hugging Face for some of my natural language processing tasks.

  Image Classification for Sumthing.org: While developing an image classifier for the NGO sumthing, my initial custom CNNs didn’t yield the desired results. However, by using transfer learning with MobileNetV2, I was able to achieve significant accuracy enhancements. This experience took a lot of trial and error and it highlights my adaptability and dedication in applying ML solutions. I'd be pleased to share this project's code, which is stored on Kaggle notebooks. However, since I cannot make it public, I would need to add you as collaborators on Kaggle. Could you direct me on the next steps, understanding the significance of presenting real-world ML achievements?

Music & Technology Intersection: From my days in music school to playing the guitar just for the joy of it, music has always been close to my heart. I remember the nuances of music theory and, honestly, I'm planning to buy a ukulele once I get this job at Yousician – hoping to make the most of that free lesson perk (assuming I get free access to your courses :)! With my tech expertise, I'm eager to contribute to Yousician's innovative approach to music education.

Technical Expertise: My academic journey at Metropolia University, where I pursued a degree in IoT and the exchange semester I did in Amsterdam for Big Data, has laid a strong foundation for my technical acumen. My proficiency in Linux, especially Debian, complements my extensive use of Python for data tasks and machine learning. I've applied these skills in projects using Flask, VueJS, and Raspberry Pi for various applications. With hands-on experience in tools like Power BI and Tableau, my web scraping capabilities, I'm well-prepared for diverse technological challenges.

In summary, I bring to the table not only a solid grounding in machine learning but also a genuine passion for music that aligns with Yousician's mission. I'm enthusiastic about the opportunity to combine these two worlds, leveraging technology to transform music learning experiences. The thought of joining Yousician has me on the edge of my seat with excitement! This isn't some generic pitch; I'm genuinely stoked about the potential role. Fingers crossed to hear from you soon and dive into all the ways I can bring value to the team!
