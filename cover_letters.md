Yousician; Machine Learning/AI Software Developer (Python)

Dear Yousician Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Machine Learning/AI Software Developer position at Yousician. As a dedicated Data Analyst and a passionate music enthusiast, I believe my blend of experience in machine learning and music makes me a strong candidate for this role.

Machine Learning experience:
  Innovative Use of GPT-4 for Job Hunting: I've crafted a script using the GPT-4 API to directly compare my CV with job postings, like Yousician's. It identifies overlapping skills and qualifications, then gives a user-friendly summary of how well I match up. It's a testament to both my practical understanding of AI and my knack for using it to solve real-world problems. I've also used Hugging Face for some of my natural language processing tasks.

  Image Classification for Sumthing.org: While developing an image classifier for the NGO sumthing, my initial custom CNNs didn’t yield the desired results. However, by using transfer learning with MobileNetV2, I was able to achieve significant accuracy enhancements. This experience took a lot of trial and error and it highlights my adaptability and dedication in applying ML solutions. I'd be pleased to share this project's code, which is stored on Kaggle notebooks. However, since I cannot make it public, I would need to add you as collaborators on Kaggle. Could you direct me on the next steps, understanding the significance of presenting real-world ML achievements?

Music & Technology Intersection: From my days in music school to playing the guitar just for the joy of it, music has always been close to my heart. I remember the nuances of music theory and, honestly, I'm planning to buy a ukulele once I get this job at Yousician – hoping to make the most of that free lesson perk (assuming I get free access to your courses :)!
