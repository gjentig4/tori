  Dear Emma Koskinen,

I'm reaching out to express my keen interest in the trainee and thesis opportunities at Ensto. Having garnered practical experience as a Data Analyst and holding a profound academic foundation in both IoT and Big Data, I believe I am a good fit for your company. This cover letter summarizes how background aligns with this jobs requirement.

While working at Triomed, I extensively utilized SQL to manage and analyze datasets with more than 10 million data points. This hands-on experience is enriched by my academic pursuits in Metropolia, Finland, and during my exchange program in Amsterdam, focusing intensively on databases, data collection, and storage. Additionally, I possess strong proficiency in Python for data manipulation and have experience in implementing machine learning algorithms, positioning me well for advanced data tasks.

A testament to my ability in data handling is the GPU Marketplace Scraper & Data Processor project I undertook in my free time. This involved developing a web scraper to extract GPU details from Tori.fi, followed by a sophisticated data cleaning and analysis process. My script categorized GPUs based on their specifications using advanced techniques. Additionally, it is equipped with an alert system, which notifies the user whenever a GPU, that's priced lower than its category average, is posted. This project not only underscores my proficiency in data collection and cleaning but also in designing real-world applications to meet specific user requirements. My expertise in using data visualization tools like Power Bi and Tableau further amplifies my readiness for potential tasks I will encounter.

The opportunity to join Loihde Advance's data community is truly exciting. I am confident in the skills and experiences I bring to the table and am eager to further discuss how I can be a significant asset to your team.

Best regards,
Gent Thaqi
