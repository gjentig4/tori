I'm a data analyst by proffession but my studies in Embedded Systems and IoT have given me a unique mix of skills. I'm good with hardware, and I've worked on projects with IoT devices and even designed some PCBs. This background helps me understand the tech side of gaming computers deeply.

On the data side, I use tools to collect information from the web, like what kind of gaming setups people are talking about or looking for. After gathering this data, I use machine learning to dig into it and find patterns or trends. This can be super helpful to know what gamers might want next. Finally, I can present all this information in easy-to-understand visuals using tools like Power Bi and Tableau. In simple terms, I can help HPC Lab stay ahead by understanding what gamers really want, using both data and hardware knowledge.

Dear Metacore Hiring Team

I'm interested in the Data Analyst role for the Merge Mansion team. With my experience and skills, I believe I can be a valuable addition to your team. 

At my last workplace, I often used Python and SQL to look at big sets of data. I know how to use cloud places to store data like BigQuery and I've worked with tools like Power Bi and Tableau to show the data in clear ways, which were later used to make business decisions. 

One project I'm proud of is the GPU Marketplace Scraper. I used web scraping and collected data from online marketplaces. Later I cleaned this data and performed data analysis so that I could get a good grasp of the GPU market in Finland. I'm a gamer after all, so having a nice GPU is essential. I think doing projects like this has made me ready to work at Metacore.

I'm excited to use my skills and love for games to help Metacore. I hope I can join your team and make Merge Mansion even better.

Thank you for looking at my letter. I'd love to chat more about how I can be a good fit for Metacore.

Best,
Gent Thaqi
